<h3 id="post-excerpts">Post excerpts</h3>
<p>To display post excerpt in a post list, simply use “excerpt” variable on a post.</p>

<p><span class="liquid"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{ post.excerpt }}</code></span></p>

<p>By default, excerpt variable displays the first paragraph of post like this:
<img src="/assets/postimages/20220507-1.png" alt="Post excerpt sample 1" title="Post excerpt sapmle 1" /></p>

<h3 id="customize-excerpt-length">Customize excerpt length</h3>
<p>To customize the length of excerpt, add “excerpt_separator” to post’s front matter or _config.yml.</p>

<p><span class="liquid">excerpt_separator: &lt;!<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--more--</code>&gt;</span></p>

<p>Then add &lt;!<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--more--</code>&gt; in a post, wherever you want to split the content.
<img src="/assets/postimages/20220507-2.png" alt="Post excerpt sample 2" title="Post excerpt sample 2" /></p>

<p>If you don’t add or forget to add a separator to your post, “excerpt” variable shows a whole content of your post.</p>

<h3 id="another-way-to-show-excerpts">Another way to show excerpts</h3>
<p>There is another way to show post excerpts, using Liquid filters.</p>

<p><span class="liquid">truncatewords</span> shortens a string down to the number of words specified as an argument, and add an ellipsis(…) at the end of the string.</p>

<p>For example, this will display first 30 words of a post<br />
<span class="liquid">{{ post.content | truncatewords: 30 }}</span></p>

<p>like this:<br />
<img src="/assets/postimages/20220507-3.png" alt="Post excerpt sample 3" title="Post excerpt sample 3" /></p>

<p>However, downside of using truncatewords filter is, if any headers are included within the specified number of words, the result doesn’t look right, like this:<br />
<img src="/assets/postimages/20220507-4.png" alt="Post excerpt sample 4" title="Post excerpt sample 4" /><br />
This is not cool.<br />
And the same thing happens when you use excerpt_separator, if you add separator after some header in you post.</p>

<p>So, in some case <span class="liquid">truncatewords</span> filter works, in other case it doesn’t. For now, this blog uses “excerpt” variable to display post excerpts. I will continue working on this.</p>

<p>That’s all for today.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this blog for the last couple of days, and finally launched with subdomain of codedlovely.net. I built this blog from scratch while referring to the Jekyll official documentation. Ah, this sense of accomplishment ☺.</p>

<p>Next thing I’m going to do is adding categories to posts and creating archive pages by category. Well, archive pages are meaningless until I publish multiple posts under multiple categories, so it will take time to display those pages on this blog.</p>

<p>These days I’m exploring the music genre called “raudo-rokku (loud rock)” in Japan, a type of rock music, since for some reason it appeared in my Spotify recommendation weeks ago. Though I’ve never been an avid rock music fan, as I keep listening to I think I’m developing a taste for this kind of music.</p>

<hr />

<p>By the way, I found this quote on the internet. It’s funny and so true, I think I should write it down here.</p>
